# CSV-File-Reader
a simple program that reads the csv file and show the data by a image of  elephant. Includes auto resizing feature.
those two .java files should be included in a package called cw3.
csv.txt and example.csv is the test file that I used.
ele2.png is the image of the elephant that represents the data in the csv file.
